## Brief History or Origin Story
DevMentor was born from the recognition that quality mentorship is the fastest path to professional growth, yet finding the right mentor has always been challenging and inefficient. 

Founded in 2025, DevMentor emerged as a solution to bridge the gap between experienced professionals willing to share their knowledge and ambitious individuals seeking guidance. Our platform was designed with the understanding that mentorship shouldn't be limited by geography, networking circles, or lengthy matching processes.

DevMentor eliminates these friction points by creating a seamless, professional platform where expertise meets opportunity.
